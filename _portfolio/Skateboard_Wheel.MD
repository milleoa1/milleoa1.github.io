## About this Project

This is a project that I completed for the Additive Polymer Based Manufacturing (CHBE 4200) class at Vanderbilt in fall of 2022. In this project, I had to design a basic skateboard wheel based off of existing designs and then create an injection molding assembly to successfully produce this model.

## Wheel Design

I originally designed this wheel to be a mix between an offroading and street wheel. This was done by choosing a TPU with a shore hardness of 82A. The biggest constraint with this project was that it had to be tailored to the APSX-PIM Desktop Injection Molding Machine. This injection molding machine only had a shot volume of 30 cubic centimeters, which is much smaller than the typical skateboard wheel. To meet this requirement, numerous cutouts were made in the bulk of the wheel.


## Mold Design

The mold was designed to have radial runners coming out of the initial sprue. This allowed me to add up to eight injection points which guaranteed me a fill confidence of 100% in Fusion 360. There was also an ejector assembly component to this mold as well. I ended up placing ejector pins in four parts of the wheel. These pins were placed at some of the thickest parts of the wheel and the midway point between the center and edge of the wheel to allow for even ejection of the part.
