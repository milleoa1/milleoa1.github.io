# Salmon Fishing

Owen has spent the summers of 2020, 2021, and 2022 commercial salmon fishing on the F/V Miss Lori based out of Kodiak, Alaska. Although all crewmembers are capable of completing all necessary tasks, Owen specialized in the following:

* Developing and maintaining an inventory of all items on-board
* Performing and assisting with general maintenance of on-board systems
* Operating hydraulics and "running the deck" to ensure proper procurement of fish

His efforts, coupled with those of the other crew, helped the F/V Miss Lori procure at least 700,000 pounds of wild Alaskan salmon per year and be in the top 20 boats in the Kodiak Management Area in terms of landings by weight.
