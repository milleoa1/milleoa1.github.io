Hello there! I'm Owen Miller, a passionate Chemical Engineering student with a diverse background in commercial fishing and manufacturing. Here's a glimpse of my education, technical skills, work experience, and leadership roles:

## Education

I have developed a strong work ethic through years of commercial fishing, which has allowed me to maintain an excellent academic record while attending Vanderbilt University. My relevant coursework includes Organic Chemistry, Applied Behavioral Science, Additive Polymer-Based Manufacturing, and many more.

- **Vanderbilt University (2021 - Present)**
  - B.Eng. Chemical Engineering
  - Minoring in Chemistry and Digital Fabrication
  - Dean's List Award in Fall 2021, Spring 2022, Fall 2022
  - Anticipated Graduation in May 2025

## Technical Skills

At Vanderbilt, I have taken coursework that has developed and refined my skills in using different additive manufacturing techniques and the Fusion 360 CAD software. I have experience in the following additive manufacturing technologies:

- Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF)
- Stereolithography (SLA)
- Selective Laser Sintering (SLS)
- Injection Molding

During my previous work experience, I have focused on maintaining and repairing mechanical components as well as creating systems for everyday use. I have experience in the following maintenance and manufacturing techniques:

- Preventative Maintenance
- Autonomous Maintenance
- Maintenance Planning
- Lean 5S
- Inventory Management

## Work Experience

### Procter and Gamble Internship

I completed an internship at the Procter and Gamble Baby Care site in Cape Girardeau, MO during the summer of 2023. During this internship, I gained valuable experience in cross-functional collaboration, project management, and much more when completing these projects:

- Led the collaborative development of a PowerBI dashboard to create a high-level overview of a manufacturing monitoring system. This process involved adapting current Python scripts to query approximately 30 PLC tags from 15+ manufacturing lines, data manipulation in Python, and visualization using Power BI.
- Drove a cross-functional proof of concept study for the re-application of a maintenance application developed at another manufacturing site. We targeted cost reduction by innovating the current preventative maintenance techniques.
- Led a cost-reduction initiative by optimizing an on-site rebuild workshop using Lean Manufacturing's 5S principles. I coordinated resources from various plants to design efficient processes. We achieved a projected significant cost reduction from $250K/year to $100K/year.

All of these projects were completed to decrease the maintenance and repair costs of the plant, allowing the plant to increase its production capability.

### Salmon Fishing

I have spent the summers of 2020, 2021, and 2022 commercial salmon fishing on the F/V Miss Lori based out of Kodiak, Alaska. Although all crew members are capable of completing all necessary tasks, I specialized in the following:

- Developing and maintaining an inventory of all items on-board
- Performing and assisting with general maintenance of on-board systems
- Operating hydraulics and "running the deck" to ensure the proper procurement of fish
- Repair and troubleshooting of electronic navigation technology

My efforts and those of the other crew helped the F/V Miss Lori procure at least 700,000 pounds of wild Alaskan salmon per year and be in the top 20 boats in the Kodiak Management Area in landings by weight.

## Leadership

### Vanderbilt Athletic Bands

I am extremely active in the Vanderbilt athletic bands during the fall and spring semesters. During the 2022 NCAA Football Season, I was chosen to be the Euphonium Section Leader for the Vanderbilt Spirit of Gold Marching Band. In this role, I had to teach and develop those in my section into better people and players while also communicating any problems to directorial staff in order to quickly create a solution.

For the 2023 NCAA Football Season, I have been chosen to be the Head Drum Major for the Vanderbilt Spirit of Gold Marching Band. In this role, I take on many of the same responsibilities that I took on when I was a section leader, but I scale up actions to affect the entire ensemble.
